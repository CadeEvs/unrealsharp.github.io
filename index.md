UnrealSharp is a plugin for Unreal Engine 5 that allows game developers to use C# in their projects with the power of .NET 8. It bridges the gap between C# and UE5, providing a seamless and efficient workflow for those who prefer C# over C++/Blueprints.

## Special Thanks
I'd like to give a huge shoutout to [MonoUE](https://mono-ue.github.io/) (Sadly abandoned :( ) for the great resource for integrating C# into Unreal Engine. Some of the systems are modified versions of their integration, and it's been a real time saver. 

**Thank you to the MonoUE team!**
